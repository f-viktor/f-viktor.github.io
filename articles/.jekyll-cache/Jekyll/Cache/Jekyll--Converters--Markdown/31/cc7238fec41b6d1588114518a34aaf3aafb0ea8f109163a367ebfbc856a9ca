<p><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-lehmann.pdf">Before going trying the tasks, please read this, it will help a lot.</a></p>

<p>Sidenote: The tasks are all compiled with emscripten, which takes input in a popup window before the task starts. After sending in your input, it will pop up again until you press cancel. To use it correctly, youâ€™ll need to enter your input in the first popup, and cancel the second one.</p>

<p>Your task here is to change the isAdmin parameter from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> when it is printed.</p>
